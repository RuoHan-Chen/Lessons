### Christmas Tree Exercise

Write a Python program that prints a Christmas tree using asterisks (`*`). Your tree should meet the following criteria:

1. **Tree Shape**:
   - The tree has multiple levels of branches, with each level having an increasing number of `*` symbols, centered to form a triangle shape.

2. **Trunk**:
   - The tree should have a trunk made of vertical bars (`|`), centered below the branches.
   - The width and height of the trunk should be proportional to the size of the tree.

3. **Customization**:
   - Allow the user to input the height of the tree (number of levels of branches).
   - The program should adapt the size of the tree and the trunk based on the input.

### Example

For an input height of 5, your tree should look similar to this:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
   |||
   |||
```

Try to make the tree look as realistic as possible and keep it centered!
